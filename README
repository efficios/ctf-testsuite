ctf-testsuite
=============

The Common Trace Format (CTF) testsuite is intended to validate the conformance of CTF readers.

To run the testsuite simply export CTF_READER_BIN="$YOUR_CTF_READER" and
use the run.sh script found in the tests/1.8/ or tests/1.9/ folder,
depending on the CTF specification version you want to check.
